The scfe extension is proprietary for the program to save and load
files.
The buttons on the left are used to select tools. If the arrow
is selected, clicking within 5 pixels of a shape will select that shape.
Clicking and dragging a control point for the shape will move that control point.
Clicking and dragging a shape not by a control point will move the entire shape.
Dragging while not over a shape will create a selection box that selects all
shapes which are entirely in the box. The control points of the selection
box will move, stretch, or rotate all of the selected shapes together.
Selecting a shape tool on the left will cause clicking and dragging to create a
new shape of that type which can then be selected and manipulated.
